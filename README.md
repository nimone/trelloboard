# [Trello Board](https://trelloboard.pages.dev/) 📌

A Trelloboard to help manage and visualize your project workload & progress with a simple & pretty interface (basically a trello clone).

> Breaking Change: with the introduction of projects/boards the store state has been changed. If you were using the app previously this version will crash, **you have to clear the application local storage yourself for this version to work**.
